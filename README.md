# Brain_tumor

Idea for this project is using Segmentation. I'm using data on Kaggle dataset [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jakeshbohaju/brain-tumor)

Firts, preprocessing data in preprocessing.py, I extract all of location of tumor (x, y) and display on mask. I saved it in mask folder.
